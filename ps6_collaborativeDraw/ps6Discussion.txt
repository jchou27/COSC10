An unexpected multi-client issues include conflicted command conditions where two or more client try to modify
the same data (shape in this case) simultaneously, leading to inconsistent states. Another one is deadlocks where
two or more clients are waiting for each other to release a resource. To prevent this, we can use synchronized to make
sure that only one thread can access the method at a time. But this could impact performance as it would force clients
to wait for each other to finish before modifying the sketch.
