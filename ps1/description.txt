1. For RegionsTest, you will see a solid color that fills baker library since I set the randomized color outside of the
regions loop @ the recoloredImage() in RegionFinder
2. For CamPaint, the user can click on a targetcolor they want from the webcam and the findRegions() @ RegionFinder will
find the region closes to the targetcolor. The limitations are that it is hard when the user background color is similar
to the target color or in a dim light setting. I tried to use a bright-colored pencil tip to write the word "HI".
